## How does JW Analytics work in Applicaster? 
Applicaster has a JW Analytics Plugin that feeds events to the [JW OTT Ping Interface](https://github.com/jwplayer/ott-web-app/blob/develop/docs/features/video-analytics.md)

The plugin sends 'pings' to JW Player endpoint when
- Video has been loaded
- While a video is played (every x seconds)
- When an advertisement is shown

The parameters send to JW Player include:
- The video being watched
- The device and operation systems of the user
- The application (version) of the user
- The `analytics id` belonging to the JW customer environment

Full details of the JW OTT Ping Interface can be found [here](https://github.com/jwplayer/ott-web-app/blob/develop/docs/features/video-analytics.md)

## How to setup JW analytics?
The JW plugin needs to be enabled in Applicaster:
1. Retrieve the JW token from the JW account manager or solution engineer.
1. Add the JW Analytics plugin from the gallery
1. Insert the JW token provided by the JW AM/SE and save
1. Build the app so the changes will take effect.

 *Applicaster uses the same analytics token for all platforms (iOS/Android etc.).
