<img align="right" src="./img/movie-target.png" width="250">
A 'target' screen is where the user lands after selecting a video from a homepage or library.

Commonly used target screens  
- A movie target: that promotes a movie by giving he full details about the video, like a description, rating, duration, etc. 
- Series target. 
- Player target. 

This article focuses on Player target screen 

## Structure of a movie target screen
A standard movie target screen consist of:
1. An player 
1. A related videos shelf

## Define a player  screen as target
1. Create a'general content screen' 
1. Define it a 'target' for 'video' using [type mapping](https://docs.applicaster.com/using-zapp/app-building-walk-through/#add-type-mapping)

By default everytime a feed is setup in Applicaster there has to be a value defined, applicaster by default defines this value as Video in the feeds that is returned from JWplatform. 

It is this value is what then used in Type screen definition in Applicasters Zapp platform to tell the app what screen needs to be opened for the media that has this value in it. In this case the value defined is video player which then opens the video player in the app.
