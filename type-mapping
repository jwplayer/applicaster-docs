## About Type Mapping
<img align="right" src="./img/movie-target.png" width="250">
Type mapping defines on which screen a viewer lands after selecting a video item from a landingpage, library or any other page.

Commonly used screens:
- A movie screen: that promotes a movie by giving the full details about the video, like a description, rating, duration, etc. 
- Series screen. That shows the episodes of the series. 
- Player screen. See [video playback](https://jwplayer.github.io/applicaster-docs/video-playback.html)

You can override this default on two levels:
- Media level, using custom parameter `contentType`
- Feed level, using `?overrideType=movie`

## Find the Zapp video type
