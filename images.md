## Image handling in JW Player
In JW Player each media item has a thumbnail, which have the following behavior:
- A static thumbnail is automatically taken from a frame of the video in 16:9 ratio. It is possible to select another frame from the video. 
- A custom thumbnail can be uploaded, with a custom aspect ratio
- The thumbnails are included in the delivery API in the Media and Playlist endpoints
- Thumbnails are made available in different widths: 320/460/640/720/1280/1920px. The aspect ratio is not adjusted.

## Image handling in Applicaster: 
When creating/modifying a cell style, you can assign the image to be used using the `image key`. The default is: `image_base`. 

You can change the image size you desire based on the resolutions delivered on the JW feed. It is also possible to define the image

## Uploading custom video thumbnail
To upload a custom video thumbnails, with a custom aspect ratio, see [here](https://support.jwplayer.com/articles/update-a-video-thumbnail)

## Adding additional images to a video in JW Player
In some cases the a single JW video thumbnail is not enough. E.g. when you need 
- a different aspect ratio on a specific layout e.g. landscape 9:13 on Roku
- a wide banner for display in the "featured" shelf
- a thumbnail with the title as part of the image for a specific platform. 

It is possible to upload additional images in JW Player as follows: 
1. Upload a dummy video in the media library. E.g. foo.mp4
1. Override the default image with a new image. This can be of a different aspect ratio
1. Add a custom property on the media according to format `img[LabelName]` for example  `imgHeroRoku`. See also the [field catalog](https://marcovandeveen.github.io/jwp-applicaster-docs/reference/field-catalog.html) 
1. Assign the custom property with the image url of the newly create media according to format: `https://content.jwplatform.com/v2/media/{mediaid}/poster.jpg?width={width}`. For example: `https://content.jwplatform.com/v2/media/dwEE1oBP/poster.jpg?width=720`
1. Open Aplicaster studio and assign the image key of the cell used, e.g. `extensions.imgHeroRoku`

Note: A more simple workflow is under development.

## Motion thumbnails
Applicaster does not support motion thumbnail at the moment.
