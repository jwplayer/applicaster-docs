## 24x7 streams as media in JW Player
Broadcast Live 24x7 streams are available as media items in the JW Dashboard. Those media items can be grouped into JW Player playlists, and these playlists can be registered as feeds in Applicaster. 

Broadcast Live will automatically add and update the media items with custom fields in JW Player. Manually added fields do not get overwritten by Broadcast Live.

## Media types in Zapp
Zapp assigns a type `live-now` to 24x7 streams based on `VCH.EventState` = `LIVE_PUBLISHED`.
