- dynamic: automatically curated lists based on tags, and sorted on views or publish data. 
- recommendations: creates a list of videos based on the video that a viewer watches
- search: creates a list of videos in your library based on a keyword search

## Components
A component is a UI entity that hightligs a video or a list of videos. The UI representation of a component is flexible (e.g. grid, horizontal list, etc). 

The most used components are
- Grid: to show a list video 
- Horitzontal List: to show a list of videos in an horizontal row, a.k.a. a 'shelf'
- Hero: to highlight an individual video

## Feeds
To be able to display the list of teasers it needs to access the data to render a item or list of items (e.g. its title, its description, its thumbnail and what screen to open). Feeds can be defined within Zapp Studio. The data of Feeds come from JW Playlists.
